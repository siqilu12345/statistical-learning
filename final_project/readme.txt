This folder contains my work for the final project of Statistical Learning. I took part in a competition in Kaggle, and ranked first 10%. The problem is to predict the destination of the taxi car based on some GPS location of the journey. The problem is particularly difficult because the data file is very large for individual competitors, about 1200MB, and since that, I don't include the data file in the repository. I first deleted unrelated data to make the file small enough for further work. Then I used classification to divide the file into different smaller parts. Finally, I used 3 different ways to predict the destination, Adaboost Regression, Adaboost Classification combined with clustering and Deep Learning. The best result was got by Adaboost Classification.
